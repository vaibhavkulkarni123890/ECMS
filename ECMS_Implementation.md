     - Start and completion timestamps
2. Implement model methods for common operations
3. Set up database migrations

### Step 3: API Development

**Requirements:**

3. Add custom API endpoints for:
   - Document search functionality
   - Document approval/rejection
   - Version comparison
4. Configure URL routing for all API endpoints
5. Implement JWT authentication
6. Set up permission classes for different user roles

### Step 4: Frontend Foundation

**Requirements:**
